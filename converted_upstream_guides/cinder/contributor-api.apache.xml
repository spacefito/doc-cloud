    <para>Copy the file etc/cinder/api-httpd.conf to the appropriate location for your Apache server, most likely:</para>
    <para>
      <literal>/etc/httpd/conf.d/cinder_wsgi.conf</literal>
    </para>
    <para>Update this file to match your system configuration (for example, some distributions put httpd logs in the apache2 directory and some in the httpd directory).
                Create the directory /var/www/cgi-bin/cinder/. You can either hard or soft link the file cinder/wsgi/wsgi.py to be osapi_volume under the /var/www/cgi-bin/cinder/ directory. For a distribution appropriate place, it should probably be copied to:</para>
    <para>
      <literal>/usr/share/openstack/cinder/httpd/cinder.py</literal>
    </para>
    <para>Cinder’s primary configuration file (etc/cinder.conf) and the PasteDeploy configuration file (etc/cinder-paste.ini) must be readable to httpd in one of the default locations described in Configuring Cinder.</para>
